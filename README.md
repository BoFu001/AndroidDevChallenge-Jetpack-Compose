## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
Hello, I'm Bo Fu. I tried my best to complete this project with Jetpack Compose. I implemented also a little bit animation, however, it is still simple. But I still like it. In this single page application you can see a time indicator and two buttons, when you tap on "START", it begins to count down, if you tap on "STOP", it stops. Is it funny?

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Kotlin is one of my favorite programming language, and I'm always attentive and careful about new trend about Android development. Android developer challenge is a very good occasion to learn new trend, by challenge you self you can understand better what is you weakness and strength.
